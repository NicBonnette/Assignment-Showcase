"# Assignment-Showcase" 

This repository collates examples of my recent coding work.

They are assignments from the courses COMP307 Artificial Intelligence and COMP361 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, all are coded in Java.

They are algorithmic in nature, so nothing flashy to look at unfortunately.  I have done other assignment work with visual appeal in 2015, but it includes material copyrighted to the university, so cannot be included with my example code here. 

I have included executable jars (with required supplementary files), and source code.
